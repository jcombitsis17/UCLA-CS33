Method (1) and (3) are the same. Method (2) is different because of the 
-fwrapv flag. (1) and (3) always return 0 because it knows that the
addition will overflow, and that n + any positive number can never be less than
n. (2) performs the full set of instructions, including the addition, because
the -fwrapv flag tells the compiler to handle overflow by overflowing from 
LONG_MAX to LONG_MIN.

(1), (3) Assembly Code:

xorl    %eax, %eax
ret

(2) Assembly Code:

movabsq $9223372036854775807, %rax
addq    %rdi, %rax
cmpq    %rdi, %rax
setl    %al
ret
