A. The function copy_int always copies the value to the buffer because when maxbytes, a signed value, and sizeof(val), an unsigned value, are subtracted, the result (by default in C) is an unsigned value. An unsigned value is always >= 0, so the if statement is always true, even when maxbytes is too small.

B. To fix this problem, the expression sizeof(val) needs to be signed before it is subtracted. So the if statement would become:

if (maxbytes-(int)sizeof(val) >= 0)...
