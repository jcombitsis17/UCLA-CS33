1. Gather Instruction Traces

gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1
Use gdb to debug emacs

break Ftimes
set a breakpoint at the Ftimes function

set disassemble-next-line on
Set debugger so that it shows the assembly code

r -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
run command so that it stops at the breakpoint

info registers (or i r [reg])
View the state of all registers

si
Step to next instruction

x [address]
Access memory at [addr]

*** i r [reg], si, and x [addr] were repeated multiple times 
    until I reached the end of the Ftimes function ***
